## Review of Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey
 
Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey is a fun and creative DLC that adds more content and replay value to the original game. The DLC lets you experience the story from your friend's perspective, as he tries to escape from Zarp's clutches and find his way back to you. The DLC also introduces new enemies, environments, and puzzles that will challenge your drawing skills and imagination.
 
The gameplay of Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey is similar to the base game, but with some twists. You can still draw your own hero and use different pencils to interact with the world, such as fire, cloud, key, axe, etc. However, you will also encounter new situations that require you to think outside the box and use your pencils in creative ways. For example, you may need to draw a boat to sail across the sea, or draw a balloon to float in the air. You will also face new foes such as pirates, ghosts, and lava monsters that will test your reflexes and combat skills.
 
The graphics and sound of Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey are also improved from the base game. The DLC features more colorful and detailed environments that range from haunted islands to cloud castles. The sound effects and music are also more varied and fitting for each level. The DLC also has more hidden content exclusive to Steam, such as achievements, trading cards, and secrets.
 
The only downside of Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey is that it is relatively short and easy. The DLC can be completed in about an hour or less, depending on your skill level and exploration. The puzzles and enemies are not very difficult or complex, and you can easily breeze through them with some trial and error. The DLC also does not add much to the story or character development of your friend, and it mostly serves as a side quest rather than a main plot.
 
Overall, Draw a Stickman: EPIC - Friend's Journey is a worthwhile DLC for fans of the original game who want more content and fun. The DLC offers more levels, puzzles, enemies, and secrets that will keep you entertained for a while. The DLC also showcases your friend's journey and gives you a different perspective on the adventure. The DLC is not very long or challenging, but it is still enjoyable and creative.
